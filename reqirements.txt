# Compiler Requirements
Visual Studio 2019 or later, or GCC with MinGW  # For C++ compilation

# Windows SDK
# Ensure that the Windows SDK is installed for access to Windows API libraries (e.g., winmm.lib for multimedia functions)

# Required Libraries and Packages
stdlib         # Standard library for general functions
stdio          # Standard I/O functions
math           # Mathematical functions (e.g., for floating-point precision calculations)
float.h        # Limits for floating-point types (e.g., DBL_MAX)
direct.h       # Directory management functions (e.g., _mkdir for folder operations)
windows.h      # Core Windows API for multimedia and file operations
mmsystem.h     # Windows Multimedia API, required for recording and playback
conio.h        # Console I/O for non-standard functions like _getch()
thread         # Multithreading library for managing concurrent tasks
iostream       # Standard C++ input/output stream
string         # Standard C++ string handling
vector         # Standard C++ vector for dynamic arrays
locale         # Locale functions, often used with codecvt for encoding conversions
codecvt        # Encoding conversion, specifically for std::wstring_convert

# Linker Settings
